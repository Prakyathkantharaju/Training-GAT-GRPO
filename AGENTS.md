# Agent Guidelines

This document provides guidelines for agentic coding agents working in this repository.

## 1. Build/Lint/Test Commands
- **Build**: No explicit build command found. Please refer to project-specific documentation or infer from file types.
- **Lint**: No explicit lint command found.
- **Test**: No explicit test command found. To run tests, refer to the testing framework used in the project (e.g., `pytest`, `go test`, `npm test`) and execute tests accordingly.

## 2. Code Style Guidelines
- **Imports**: Organize imports alphabetically and group them by type (e.g., standard library, third-party, local).
- **Formatting**: Adhere to the existing code formatting. If no specific formatter is configured, use a consistent style (e.g., 4-space indentation, consistent bracing).
- **Types**: Use type hints/annotations where supported and appropriate to improve code readability and maintainability.
- **Naming Conventions**: Follow established naming conventions for variables, functions, classes, and files. Prefer descriptive names.
- **Error Handling**: Implement robust error handling using appropriate mechanisms (e.g., try-except blocks, error codes, result types).
